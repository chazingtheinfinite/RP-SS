### Accelerating Reciprocal Perspective using Subsampling
Author: Kevin Dick

To speedup the estimation of the baseline in rank order data, we investigate the possibility of approximating the baseline using an incomplete set of predictions. The sparsity of these data are thus used to converge towards the baseline by leveraging the fact that the majority of data points reside in the baseline of the One-to-All score curves.
